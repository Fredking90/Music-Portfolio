					<h4>The Art of Learning Piano </h4>
					<p> When it comes to learning the piano , yeah its cool to learn how to play ,but its the disicpline that comes with learning a new musical language. The dedication to sit and learn a piece for 2 hours everyday until you can memorize it and play it everyone of people. That is a skill , that not many people have, and should be applauded.</p>
					<p> When I started piano , I started playing piano 30 minutes a day, but when I started to progress as a pianist , 30 minutes wasn't enough for me. I needed to spend 1-2 hours in order to hone my skills, and this is where disicpline came in , you have to be able to be true to yourself and understand what you lack in order to grow. </p>

					<p>When I started to get better at piano, I decided to branch off and learn how to play by ears. When a pianist says that they want to learn how to play by ears that simply means that they no longer want to use sheet music , they would like to listen to the medlody and play it their own way. Which is something that takes time to learn, as a musician you never stop learning because they are new melodies everywhere.</p>

					<h6>The Job Of A Pianist  -</h6>
				</div>
				<div class="ab-r">
					<p>My teacher once taught me that the job of a pianist is to entertain people while trying to speak to them in a musical language. This is something I have learning how to do and it takes time, this is something that my teacher tried to teach me. Since he has passed away I have never stopped practicing and took matters into my own hand when understanding the art of piano.</p>
					<p>My teacher has taught me alot of things about piano and with that being said , here is a video playing piano for his other students. Enjoy.</p>
